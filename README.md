## How It Works

1. **Capture:**  
   Your laptop or webcam streams video to an AI module built with MediaPipe and OpenCV.

2. **Analyze:**  
   The AI analyzes body landmarks and determines posture status (e.g., good, slouching, uneven shoulders).

3. **Automate:**  
   On poor posture, the system sends API commands to Home Assistant:
   - Adjust **desk height** (`cover.desk`) for standing or sitting correction
   - Open/close **curtains** (`cover.curtain`) for optimal lighting and comfort

4. **Home Assistant Integration:**  
   Simple REST API calls let you trigger any supported Home Assistant entityâ€”expandable to lights, blinds, thermostat, and more.
